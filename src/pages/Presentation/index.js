That is to say, if you plan to climb in March, the 2-day and 1-night package can only be booked in February. However, all seats are given priority to the 3-day and 2-night package. If the climbing quota is full, there will be no seats even if you book a month in advance."

The key difference lies in the added comfort of spending the first night at the mountain base, eliminating the need for a 2-hour journey from Kota Kinabalu to the Kinabalu Park on the second day. This allows you to commence your ascent directly from the park, saving time and energy."
